    <h2>RASGULLA</h2>
    <P>Rasgulla is a juicy milk sweet made by dunking curdled milk dollops in sugar syrup, Rasgulla is a popular Bengal
        delicacy that is made on special occasions & Diwali across India but relished almost every other day after meal
        in Bengal.</P>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>1 litre milk</strong></li>
        <li><strong>1/4 cup curd</strong></li>
        <li><strong>few icecubes</strong></li>
        <li><strong>1 cup sugar</strong></li>
        <li><strong>3 cups water</strong></li>
        <li><strong>a generous pinch cardamom powder</strong></li>
        <li><strong>5 nos pistachios for garnish</strong></li>
        <!-- Som Papadi -->
    </ul>

    <h3>Instuctions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat milk, bring it to boil. Then add curd and keep stirring. Allow it to curdle.
        </li>
        <li>Stir continuously till the whey water clears and the milk curdles completely. Now switch off the stove, add
            ice cubes and allow it to melt completely. You can clearly see the whey water now.</li>
        <li>Take a muslin cloth and pour the curdled milk, filtering the whey water completely. Wash it well in running
            cold water if you have used lemon juice to remove the lemon flavour.</li>
        <li>Squeeze the excess water and hang it aside for 30mins without disturbing it. After 30mins, the paneer would
            be crumbly in texture.</li>
        <li>Now knead it well for atleast 20mins. This is the most important step as kneading for more time ensures soft
            and spongy rasgullas, so don't lose patience. See how soft the dough has become after kneading for 20mins.
        </li>
        <li>Now pinch a small portion of the dough, form smooth balls and keep aside. I made around 20 balls, Set aside.
        </li>
        <li>Heat water in a wide bottomed vessel, then add sugar.</li>
        <li>Keep it in flame and keep stirring till sugar dissolves completely, Simmer for 5mins.</li>
        <li>When the sugar syrup boils and starts bubbling, add the balls slowly one by one. The balls will go to the
            corner, move them to the middle.</li>
        <li>Keep in medium flame and close with a lid. Cook covered for 10mins.</li>
        <li>After 10 mins, the balls would be closely doubled in size. Switch off and keep it closed aside for 15mins.
        </li>
        <li>Then cool down and add chopped pistachios and chill it until serving time.</li>
        <li>Serve Rasgulla chilled!</li>

         <h3>Instuctions</h3>
         <ul>
            <li><b>Preparation</b>
            <br> To make rasmalai you will need 12 to 15 rasgulla. Either you can buy them from stores or make them at home.
            <br> Boil ½ cup water. Then add almonds and pistachios. Cover and keep aside for 30 to 40 minutes.
            <br> Later peel the almonds, pistachios and slice them finely. Set aside.
            <br></li>
            <li><b>Thickening milk to make rabdi</b>
            <br>When the almonds are blanching, take milk in a thick bottomed pan or kadai.
            <br>Bring the milk to a boil on medium heat stirring at intervals.
            <br>Whilst the milk is coming to a boil, take 2 tablespoons of milk from the pan in a small bowl.
            <br>Let this milk become warm. Add crushed saffron strands. Stir and keep aside.
            <br>Once the milk has come to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer the milk. Collect the floating clotted cream (malai) on the sides.
            Continue to cook this way till the milk is reduced to half.
            <br>Keep on collecting the cream which floats on the top and move it to the sides.
            Also keep on stirring the milk at intervals so that the milk does not get scorched at the bottom.
            <br>Add sugar and stir well so that the sugar dissolves.
            <br>Then add cardamom powder.
            <br>Add the blanched and sliced almonds and pistachios. Reserve a few almonds and pistachios for garnishing.
            <br>Also add the saffron infused milk.
            <br>Stir again. Keep simmering the reduced milk at a low heat.</li>
            <li><b>Making rasmalai</b>
            <br>Take each rasgulla and with a spatula and apply pressure, so the excess sugar syrup is removed from it.
            <br>You can also press and squeeze each rasgulla in your palms. Be gentle and don't apply too much of pressure. As then the rasgullas will break.
            Repeat with all the rasgulla balls.
            <br>Now place the rasgulla in the simmering milk and simmer for 2 to 3 minutes on a low heat.
            <br>Switch off the heat and then add rose water or kewra water (pandanus water).
            <br>Stir gently. Cover and let the rasmalai come to room temperature. Then chill in a covered container or bowl.
            <br>Serve garnished with blanched, sliced almonds or pistachios that were kept aside and a few saffron strands.
            <br>You can also serve rasmalai warm or at room temperature.</li>
